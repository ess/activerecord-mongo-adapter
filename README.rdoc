= ActiveRecord for Mongo

This plugin provides an ActiveRecord connection adapter for Mongo
(http://www.mongodb.org/).

This plugin relies on the "mongo" Ruby Gem, which can be found at
http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver. See the README file there for
installation instructions.

After installing this plugin, you will need a db/schema.rb file and a
database.yml file. See below for instructions.


== Installing

As noted above, this plugin requires the "mongo" Ruby Gem.

To add this plugin to your Rails app, move (or link) this directory into your
Rails app's vendor/plugins directory and name it mongo_record. In other words,
this README.rdoc file should be

  RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins/mongo_record/README.rdoc


== Schema

ActiveRecord requires a schema, but Mongo is a schema-free database. This
means that you have to supply this plugin with a schema for your Mongo
database that ActiveRecord can use.

This plugin reads the file named by ENV['SCHEMA'] or, if that is not defined,
db/schema.rb to get the database schema the application wants to use.

=== Sample schema.rb

In case you need to hand-generate a schema file (for example, you don't have a
db/schema.rb file generated by "rake db:schema:dump", here is a small sample.

  ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 0) do

    create_table "students", :force => true do |t|
      t.column "name", :string, :null => false
    end

    create_table "addresses", :force => true do |t|
      t.column "student_id", :integer, :null => false
      t.column "street", :string
      t.column "city", :string
      t.column "state", :string
      t.column "postal_code", :string
    end

    add_index "addresses", ["student_id"], :name => "fk_addresses_students"

    create_table "courses", :force => true do |t|
      t.column "name",     :string
    end

    create_table "scores", :force => true do |t|
      t.column "student_id", :integer, :null => false
      t.column "course_id", :integer, :null => false
      t.column "grade", :float, :null => false
    end

  end


== Sample database.yml

  development:
    adapter: mongo
    database: foo_development

  test:
    adapter: mongo
    database: foo_test

  production:
    adapter: mongo
    database: foo_production


== Optional Logging

If you wish, you can use a Mongo capped collection for Rails log messages. To
do so, edit the file init.rb and uncomment the code following the comment that
says "Uncomment the following to log to Mongo using a capped collection." See
MongoRecord::LogDevice for details.

If enabled, log messages are sent to the capped collection named
rails_log_{RAILS_ENV}.
